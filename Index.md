# Make MIT App Inventor itsy easy

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok... lets start, I would like to introduce myself my name is Kevin C. Magnifico (you can call me KEvs) and i'm a software developer, open source supporter, and also a coding instructor who teaches the students from grade school to high school on how to code whether a text based or block based code... and that's it... i know this is awkward but anyway, just proceed to read this documentation.

Before you tackle to read this documentation, kindly please read the [notes](#h3notes) at the bottom, but don't worry it's not very serious documentation and you'll see why i've always started counting at 0 and this is not for the readers who don't like having a **sentence enhancers (often they called... a curse word)** in my documentation.

### <span id="h3notes">Notes</span>

* **Note [0]** : This documentation is good for educational purposes and who has newbies in **MIT App Inventor** and it was fun to read it.

* **Note [1]** : If you have any see wrong grammar or misspell words, you can contact me or change it by yourself, because this documentation is an open source and that you could freely to modify with it, because my mother tongue is not an english language (like bri'ish wonky teeth or filipino english speaker fanatics), just a simple english... that i could actually speak and written.

* **Note [2]** : Could... you contact me directly ? Absolutely... and this is my gmail account :  **kevinmagnifico77@gmail.com**.

* **Note [3]** : I'm a person who doesn't like speak too much... because most of my time i spent on reading software development books and do some research stuff... and my favourite **Computer languages** was **C**, **Objective-C**, **C++**, **PHP**, and **Java**... but **C** is my main choice when it comes from research and development, even though **C++** was my first computer language that i learned, when i was an a**hol* at that time... and last i'm a nerdish personality.

* **Note [4]** : Communication was not my main personality, although it was enough to be frankly.

* **Note [5]** : Always remember ***Software Development is both Academic and Technical side***, because many persons that i heard, they think software developing is only in technical side, but for me it is not, Why ? : before you building a software, you'll to study on how does it work, second you'll need able to learn some many types of **Architectures**, **Platforms**, **Compilers & Interpreters**, **Computer languages**, **Software Libraries**, **Frameworks**, **Software Development Kit**, **Version Control**, and so forth.

* **Note [6]** : This documentation is not a completed as well, although this is a good step to learn the **MIT App Inventor**, don't worry to learn this things, even me though when i learn software developing at first, I had a lot much trial and error until i achieved it.

* **Note [7]** : As you can see, i choose markdown format because it was a portable, easy to revise, and read, rather than the other documentation format like :
  
  * ***.docx**
  
  * ***.pdf**
  
  * ***.pptx**
  
  * ***.etc...**
  
  and another thing, it was simple, elegant, flexible, interactive, and open format. for more information about markdown, visit this website ([Markdown - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) if you want to furthermore information about it.

* **Note [8]** : This documentation is freely redistributable under the terms of [license](LICENSE.txt).

* **Note [9]** : It's free as in freedom and open source.

* **Note [10]** : This is the last note, i know what you thinking... and why i'm started counting at 0 ? **right (if not skip this note)** : because in most computer languages, when it comes from the ["**array**"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)) their index was started counting at 0, but anyway i know this is a little bit confusing... now lets proceed to read the chapter 0.

* **Note [11]** : Pardon... This is the last in the depths of eternity note that i need to speak with... I hate documentation that has not revisable and i refuse to read it, because most them are not pragmatically and scalability, and also this is not a type of documentation... uhhh...i think it's fine... to read that kind of stuff, but to me, it was not my type.
