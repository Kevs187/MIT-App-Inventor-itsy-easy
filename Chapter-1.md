### <span id="h3cnp">Create a new Project</span>

Now let's start making a project, first you'll need to open up your web browser and then visit this website [https://appinventor.mit.edu/](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).

Once you visited the MIT App inventor website, kindly follow this steps down below.


* **Step [0]**

  ![Step 0](assets//Chapter-1//Step-0.png)
  ![Step 0-1](assets//Chapter-1//Step-0-1.png)
  > Click the "**Create Apps**" button and then once the google sign-in show up, you must login or choose an account with it. 

* **Step [1]**

  ![Step 1](assets//Chapter-1//Step-1.png)
  ![Step 1-1](assets//Chapter-1//Step-1-1.png)
  > and then you'll see the **Terms of Services**, after that if you like to read it to make sure you are informative or else you could skip it by pressing the "**I accept the terms of service!**" button and see what happen you navigated the **IDE**, and you could finally starting to create your project.

* **Step [2]**

  ![Step 2](assets//Chapter-1//Step-2.png)
  ![Step 2-1](assets//Chapter-1//Step-2-1.png)
  <span id="Step2-2-img">![Step 2-2](assets//Chapter-1//Step-2-2.png)</span>

  > Find the "**Projects Menu**" : That besides at the right part of "**MIT App Inventor - logo**", now click it and then click the "**Start new project**" submenu. As you can see when the dialog show up, you must enter your project name (For me i name it "**TestProject**") and then press the "**OK**" button.
  > 
  > After you pressed the "**OK**" button, you'll see from the [third image](#Step2-2-img) and same as you follow the steps, you are now inside into your project and what you see is, you are now into the "**Designer**" part, that you could actually design your app whatever you like.
  > 
  > #### Take Note : 
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : You could cancel with it, by pressing the "**Cancel**" button if you don't want it.
  > 
  > * **Note [1]** : To close the project and if you want to go back from the ["**Project list**"](assets//Common//Project-List.png) click the ["**My Projects**"](assets//Common//My-Projects-menu.png) menu at the top right part.
  > 
  > * **Note [2]** : To save a project you'll need to click the "**Projects**" menu and then click the "**Save project**" submenu, If you don't get it this is the image([Save Project Image](assets//Common//Save-projects.png)).

### Explore the MIT App Inventor Interface

In "**MIT App Inventor Interface**" has a divided by parts and you'll see the [Pallete Panel](assets//Common//Pallete-Panel.png), [Designer Viewer](assets//Common//Designer-Viewer.png), [Components Panel](assets//Common//Components-Panel.png), [Media Panel](assets//Common//Media-Panel.png), [Properties Panel](assets//Common//Properties-Panel.png), [Menu](assets//Common//Menu.png), [Blocks Panel](assets//Common//Blocks-Panel.png), [Blocks Viewer](assets//Common//Blocks-Viewer.png), [Trash](assets//Common//Trash.png), [Designer and Blocks Button](assets/Common//Designer-and-Blocks-Button.png), and etc.

So we need to discuss individually all of this interface that i mentioned earlier. Ok lets start.

* **Pallete Panel**

  ![Pallete Panel](assets//Common//Pallete-Panel.png)

  > The Pallete Panel is a collection of components and it was divided in a "**14 Categories**", see at the below.
    * **User Interface**
    * **Layout**
    * **Media**
    * **Drawing and Animation**
    * **Maps**
    * **Charts**
    * **Data Science**
    * **Sensors**
    * **Social**
    * **Storage**
    * **Connectivity**
    * **LEGO® MINDSTORMS®**
    * **Experimental**
    * **Extension**
  > 
  > 
  > I know it's too many, but.. it doesn't mean you'll need to apply all of these things into your project, but anyway... each of these categories has a bunch of components for example : in **User Interface** they have Button, Label, TextBox, and etc. as you can see, they have it's own functionality and purposes.
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : The **Pallete Panel** is located from the left side and near at the **Designer Viewer**.

* **Designer Viewer**

  ![Designer Viewer](assets//Common//Designer-Viewer.png)

  > The purpose of this "**Designer Viewer**" is to make a structural design or layout for your app and to see what it looks like.
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : The **Designer Viewer** is located from the middle.
  > * **Note [1]** : In **Layout** you could arrange the UI's via veritically, horizontally, or Table in it.
  > * **Note [2]** : The (**Ctrl + C**) and (**Ctrl + V**) - (known as **Copy** and **Paste**), is working if you want to duplicate some components on it.
  > * **Note [3]** : The last thing is some components is invisible when you attached it on the **Designer Viewer** because that component was a feature not UI's.

* **Components Panel**

  ![Components Panel](assets//Common//Components-Panel.png)

  > The "**Components Panel**" is a sort of components that your putting in, that came from the "**Pallete Panel**" and you'll see all components that you attached from the "**Designer Viewer**" it will show up on the Components Panel and the other thing is, you could "***rename***" or "***delete***" the components from it.
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : The **Components Panel** is located from the right side and near at the **Designer Viewer**.

* **Media Panel**

  ![Media Panel](assets//Common//Media-Panel.png)

  > This "**Media Panel**" is a local asset for your app and those are image, video, sound, text file, and etc...
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : The **Media Panel** is located from the bottom part of the **Components Panel**.

* **Properties Panel**

  ![Properties Panel](assets//Common//Properties-Panel.png)

  > The uses of the "**Properties Panel**" is to change the appearance and behaviors of the components that you set in.
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : The **Properties Panel** is located from right side corner and it was near at **Components Panel**.
  > * **Note [1]** : Each component properties can be manipulated by using code blocks, although watch out... not all properties can possibly intereact with code blocks.

* **Menu**

  ![Menu Panel](assets//Common//Menu.png)

  > The "**Menu Panel**" is basically, this is where your project can be manipulated by opening, saving, building, debugging, guides, and other things stuff like that,
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : You can actually build an ***.apk** file for your android phone.
  > * **Note [1]** : If you want to test your app, go to **Connect** menu > **AI Companion** submenu and then click, this will generate a QR code to scan it by using [MIT AI2 Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3&hl=en&gl=US).

* **Blocks Panel**

  ![Blocks Panel](assets//Common//Blocks-Panel.png)

  > The "**Blocks Panel**" is a sort of collections of "**Built-in**" and "**Component Specific**" drawers blocks, that can be used on your app logic, and then each categories of **Built-in** and **Component specific** drawers... they have a bunch of blocks and each of those blocks has it's own functionality.
  > 
  > In **Built-in** blocks they have **9 Categories** available and each of those can be apply on the components, and the second one... **Component Specific** block is connected to the **Components Panel**, because all sort of things that you attached on [Designer Viewer](assets//Common//Designer-Viewer.png) it will be visible from this section.
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : You'll see from the **Components Specific**, they have **get** and **set**, and the meaning of these... **get** is when you get a value and **set** is when you set a value.
  > * **Note [1]** : You can actually apply a **get** value from the **variable**.
  > * **Note [2]** : You don't want to attach all the blocks from your app, because all you need to do is attach a block that you needed for.

* **Blocks Viewer**

  ![Blocks Viewer](assets//Common//Blocks-Viewer.png)

  > **Blocks Viewer** is your editor for the blocks that your putting in and this is where you make a logic for your app.
  >
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : Much better to arrange the blocks properly, because it is hard to read or to maintain if the blocks are very messy.
  > * **Note [1]** : It's much better to add a comments on the blocks, to easy to know what it is ([This is how to add comment on you block](assets//Common//Add-Comment.png)).

* **Trash**

  ![Trash](assets//Common//Trash.png)

  > Inside of **Blocks Viewer**, there is a "**Trash**" that you can actually delete the blocks that you don't needed.
  > 
  > #### Take Note :
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : Before you delete the blocks, make sure you don't need it

* **Designer and Blocks Button**

  ![Designer and Blocks Button](assets//Common//Designer-and-Blocks-Button.png)

  > The "**Designer and Blocks Button**" is an interface that you could actually switch between **Designer Viewer** and **Blocks Viewer**.

### Run it & Debugging

There are many ways to run & debug the apps that you created. first you could use the **MIT AI2 Companion**, **Emulator**, or via **USB Connection**, although the most common use is using an "**MIT AI2 Companion**" and this can be downloaded at **Play Store (For Android OS)** or **App Store (For iOS OS)**.

  ![Run and Debug](assets//Common//Debugging.png)

  > Click the **Connect** menu and see about that.
  >
  > * **AI Companion**
  > * **Emulator**
  > * **USB**
  > 
  > #### Take Note : 
  > 
  > * **Note [0]** : If there's any circumstances on your debugging just click the "**Connect**" menu and then find & click the "**Reset Connection**" submenu.
  > * **Note [1]** : If you having modify on **Blocks Viewer** and you try to test with your app, Please click the "**Refresh Companion Screen**", to refresh all the changes.
